        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Sowmya D</strong>, a passionate and driven Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a strong foundation in programming, web development, and cloud technologies. I graduated from Vidya Vikas Institute of Engineering and Technology, Mysore, with a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) and a CGPA of 8.52/10.</p>
        <p>Here are some key skills I possess:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, Java, C++, PHP, JavaScript</li>
          <li><strong>Frameworks:</strong> Django, Flask, React, Angular</li>
          <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL</li>
          <li><strong>Cloud Services:</strong> AWS</li>
          <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git, GitHub</li>
          <li><strong>Web Technologies:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’ve had the opportunity to work on multiple exciting projects, including a Legal Support App, a Student Grade Tracking System, and a Blockchain-based Counterfeit Product Detection System. In each of these projects, I played a key role in backend development, database management, and integrating various technologies to create seamless user experiences.

            I’m not just a developer, but also a quick learner, a problem-solver, and a team player who thrives in collaborative environments. I am always seeking new opportunities to expand my skill set and contribute to innovative projects that make a real-world impact.
            
            In my free time, I enjoy pencil sketching, playing throwball and kabaddi, traveling, and photography. These hobbies keep me creative and energized, which I bring into my professional work.</p>
      
        <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am a quick learner, a team player, and a problem solver. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and keep improving my skills. I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working in teams to build meaningful software that has a real-world impact.</p>
      
        <p>Thank you for your patience...@!</p>
